# ProdigyInfoTech-Internship-ML-AI
Work completed during a 4-week self-paced Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (July 2024).  Here, you'll find code and resources related to the 3 practical tasks independently selected and completed to achieve this goal.


## Task 1: House Price Prediction with Feature Engineering
This task involved predicting house prices using a machine learning model. The dataset consisted of a significant number of features (79 columns) and data points (1460 rows). To address this complexity, I implemented feature engineering techniques such as handling missing values (e.g., mean imputation) and outlier detection to prepare the data for modeling. Additionally, I employed correlation analysis to identify redundant features and feature selection algorithms to focus on the most relevant ones for predicting house prices. A linear regression model was then employed to establish the relationship between the engineered features and house prices.
